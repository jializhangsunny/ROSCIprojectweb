        The proposed ROCSI is designed to address these challenges by comprehensively capturing threat data from multiple threat sources and integrating it into the cyber security investment decision processes. The ROCSI aims to deliver threat-informed, user-tailored and up-to-date decision support which is continuously updated as new threat data becomes available. The ROCSI will output the ROI analysis on threat mitigations in response to the business processes ranked by decision makers.
