abstract: The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks and the evolution of
  security risks make it challenging for organizations to understand their
  impact on businesses. The habitual reliance on the judgment of cyber security
  experts and communication gaps between cyber security team and board members,
  responsible for making strategic cyber security investment decisions further
  weaken organization's capability to respond to cyber threats. Existing
  research lacks a transparent approach to quantify security risks and their
  impact on businesses. This paper introduces a novel CYSEM that express
  security risk in financial terms, through integrating Cyber Threat
  Intelligence (CTI) with the Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) model,
  elaborated with cyber security cost typologies. CYSEM facilitates
  communication among multi-stakeholders and improves transparency and quality
  of investment decision-making at the strategic level. We evaluate the CYSEM
  using a case study, which has showed its effectiveness in understanding the
  impact of cyber threat from an economics perspective.
