abstract: Investment in cybersecurity is critical to protect information system
  security, preserve organizational interests, and fulfil social
  responsibilities. However, due to the lack of a transparent process, investors
  often struggle to assess the effectiveness of their investments. Traditional
  return on security investment (ROSI) can be considered as an economic
  indicator which reflects investment efficiency, but it often emphasizes
  investment costs and anticipated returns while overlooks cybersecurity related
  metrics. This paper proposes the FAIR-ROSI model that integrates five
  qualitative and quantitative cybersecurity metrics with the Factor Analysis of
  Information Risk (FAIR) model. It combines practical qualitative and
  quantitative indicators to enhance the granularity of the traditional ROSI
  model. We then use a case study to evaluate the FAIR-ROSI model. The results
  from pre and post control measures shows a narrow margin between actual and
  projected loss values and a significantly higher ROI compared to the total
  security expenditure.
